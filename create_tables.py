# # Part I. ETL Pipeline for Pre-Processing the Files

# ## PLEASE RUN THE FOLLOWING CODE FOR PRE-PROCESSING THE FILES

# #### Import Python packages 

# In[14]:


# Import Python packages 
import pandas as pd
import cassandra
import re
import os
import glob
import numpy as np
import json
import csv


# #### Creating list of filepaths to process original event csv data files

# In[15]:


# checking the current working directory
print(os.getcwd())

# Get the current folder and subfolder event data
filepath = os.getcwd() + '/event_data'

# Create a for loop to create a list of files and collect each filepath
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(filepath):
    
# join the file path and roots with the subdirectories using glob
    file_path_list = glob.glob(os.path.join(root,'*'))
    #print(file_path_list)


# #### Processing the files to create the data file csv that will be used for Apache Casssandra tables

# In[16]:


# initiating an empty list of rows that will be generated from each file
full_data_rows_list = [] 
    
# for every filepath in the file path list

# Apache Cassandra tables

# # Part II. The event_datafile_new.csv contains the following columns: 
# - artist 
# - firstName of user
# - gender of user
# - item number in session
# - last name of user
# - length of the song
# - level (paid or free song)
# - location of the user
# - sessionId
# - song title
# - userId

# #### Creating a Cluster

# In[46]:


# Make a connection to a Cassandra instance the local machine 
# (127.0.0.1)

# 
# ### 1. Give me the artist, song title and song's length in the music app history that was heard during  sessionId = 338, and itemInSession  = 4
